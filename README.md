**Lung Cancer Risk Prediction Modelling (MSc Dissertation, University of Sheffield)**

R • Epidemiology • ROC/AUC • Logistic Regression • Risk Modelling

As part of my **MSc in Statistics with Medical Applications**, I conducted a full end-to-end analysis comparing lung cancer risk prediction models using patient data from the ReSoLuCENT study. This included 879 subjects (516 cases, 363 controls) with 168 variables on smoking, family history, demographics, and environmental exposure.

**What I did:**

Applied the Bach and Liverpool Lung Project (LLP) risk models to real patient data.
Processed and cleaned raw hospital data, including deriving smoking variables (pack-years, cessation duration, cigarettes-per-day) using custom R algorithms (Section 5, pp. 35–42).

Conducted ROC curve and AUC analysis to assess discriminatory power of each model.

Compared sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV of both models for 5-year absolute lung cancer risk.

Identified that the LLP model showed better discriminatory performance (AUC = 0.719) compared to Bach (AUC = 0.604) — largely due to the **inclusion of family history** as an important predictor (Results on pages 4–5 and ROC curves on pages 46 & 50).

**Key Findings:**

Family history of lung cancer significantly improves predictive power.
The LLP model offered better overall discrimination and clinical utility for identifying high-risk individuals.
Smoking duration and asbestos exposure were strong predictors; passive smoking showed little effect (Section 3.2, pp. 17–24).

**Skills Demonstrated:**

R programming • ROC/AUC analysis • Logistic modelling • Feature engineering • Epidemiological methods • Data visualisation • Handling sensitive clinical data • Statistical reporting
