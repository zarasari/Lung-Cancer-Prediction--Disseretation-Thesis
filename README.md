Lung Cancer Risk Prediction – MSc Project (Short README)

🟦 Conclusion
Using clinical data from 879 patients, I found that the Liverpool Lung Project (LLP) model predicts lung cancer risk more accurately than the Bach model.
The LLP model had a higher AUC (~0.72) versus Bach (~0.60) — largely because it includes family history of lung cancer, a strong predictor confirmed in this dataset.

🧠 Project Overview
This project compares two established lung cancer risk prediction models — LLP and Bach — using patient data from the ReSoLuCENT study (168 variables, 879 individuals).
I used R to:
Clean and prepare the clinical dataset
Engineer smoking-related predictors (pack-years, duration, cessation)
Apply both models to calculate 5-year absolute risk
Evaluate discriminatory performance using ROC curves and AUC

🔧 Tools & Skills
R programming
ROC/AUC analysis
Logistic regression & epidemiology
Clinical data analysis
Feature engineering

📁 Summary
This project shows my ability to handle high-dimensional medical data, apply risk models, and evaluate predictive performance using statistical methods relevant to healthcare analytics and Responsible AI.
